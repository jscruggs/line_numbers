Mucking about trying to use ruby_parser to find what methods are defined on what line.  Will become a gem once I get it working.

Read the specs to see how it works in detail but here's a quick example:

# File foo.rb
class Foo # Line 1
# Line 2
  def self.awesome
    1 + 1
  end
  
  def what
    12 # Line 8
  end
end

# In same Dir as foo.rb:
ln = LineNumbers.new(File.expand_path(File.dirname(__FILE__) + "/foo.rb"))

ln.in_method?(2) #=>false
ln.in_method?(8) #=> true

ln.method_at_line(8) #=> "Foo#what"
ln.method_at_line(3) #=> "Foo::awesome"


Ultimately I'm planning on using this in metric_fu to connect Rcov output with the other metrics' output so I can combine metrics.
